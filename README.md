# Games in python.
This repository is a set of 5 famous python beginner game codes.<br>
* Any Guesses? <br>
* Cows and Bulls.<br>
* Rock-Paper-Scissors.<br>
* Tic-Tac-Toe.<br>
* Hangman.<br><br>
The repository consists of python files (.py) along with of a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed summary of each game along with the rules that need to be followed while playing/coding these games. I would highly recommand an individual to view the notebook for a clear picture.<br><br>
However if you face an issue opening the notebook that looks like this "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?". Kindly perform the following two steps:<br>
* Open this link "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" on your browser.<br>
* Copy an paste the following link "https://github.com/ginelledsouza/Games-in-python/blob/master/PythonGames.ipynb" on the above opened site.
