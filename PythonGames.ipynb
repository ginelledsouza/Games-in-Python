    "This game is an easy guessing game where a player is expected to guess a number in the range of 1 to 10. In turn the computer generates a random number in the same range. The code verifies whether or not the number given by the player is a match with the number randomly generated by the computer. If it is a match it will generate a message if not it will generate a message stating how far was the user entered number from the random number, was it too high or too low?. The player may play more than one game. The code keeps a track of the number of games the player has played and displays the same at the end, when the player wishes to play the game no more."

    "Hangman is a famous word guessing game where the letters within the word are hidden. The player is expected to guess each letter in the word before they run out of attempts. whenever the player guesses a wrong letter (A letter not in the word) a part of the hangman is drawn. After a player attempts 6 wrong letters they loose.\n",
    "<blockquote><b>This code consists of the following rules:</b><br><br>1. The word generated comes from a text file randomly.<br>2. If a player guesses a wrong letter a part of the man is drawn.<br>3. If a player guesses a right letter it will be visible along with the position of that letter within the word.<br>4. The hangman created is from a basic if-else statement.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PS: The hangman can be created more dynamically but for the sake of simplicity this code has a adapted a basic approach.\n",
